## Introduction

Welcome to the Multimedia Steganography project! This project was developed during our Information Security Audit course. Steganography is the art and science of concealing messages within multimedia files like images, videos, audio files, and text documents, without attracting attention to the hidden information. The primary goal of steganography is to ensure that the hidden information remains confidential and can only be accessed by authorized parties.

Our team has implemented a multimedia steganography tool that allows users to encode and decode information in various multimedia formats securely. With the help of Python packages and Jupyter Notebook, we have created an intuitive and user-friendly interface to perform these operations seamlessly.

## Features

- **Encoding Text into Images**: Users can embed text messages into images without affecting the visual quality of the image.

- **Decoding Text from Images**: The tool can extract hidden text from steganographically modified images.

- **Encoding Videos**: Users can encode confidential videos into cover videos without causing any visible change.

- **Decoding Videos**: The tool enables the extraction of hidden videos from steganographically modified videos.

- **Audio Steganography**: Users can embed secret audio files into audio cover files, maintaining the audio quality.

- **Decoding Audio**: Hidden audio files can be extracted from steganographically modified audio files.

- **File Support**: The tool supports various multimedia formats, including JPEG/PNG images, MP4 videos, WAV audio, and text files for encoding and decoding.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python packages: OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow, MoviePy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Install the required Python packages using the following command:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python numpy pillow moviepy
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Multimedia_Steganography.ipynb`.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to encode and decode multimedia files.
3. Select the appropriate options for encoding or decoding text, images, videos, or audio files.
